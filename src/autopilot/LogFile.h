/**
   \brief This class implements the logging facility for the avionics.

   \author Bryan Godbolt <godbolt@ece.ualberta.ca>
   \date March 1, 2011: Creation of class
   \date June 18, 2011: Add separate writing thread
   @date October 20, 2011: Add boost::array log function

   This class uses the singleton design pattern to enforce the user to only
   instantiate one object.  In order to get the instance of the class you can
   declare a variable as follows,
   \code
   LogFile *log = LogFile::getInstance();
   \endcode
   Once you have a pointer to the instance of the LogFile you can just add
   vectors to a log of any type.  There is no further initialization necessary.
   \code
   vector<float> data_vector;
   // put data in data_vector for current iteration
   log->logData("file name", data_vector);
   \endcode
   The string passed as filename internally identifies a queue where the vector
   is stored.  Every time you call LogFile::logData() the data vector is appended
   to the queue identified by the file name string.

   \warning The data type of the vector passed to LogFile::logData() must implement
   the \code ostream& operator<<(ostream&, T&) \endcode
   operator, where T refers the type of the data vector.
   \note This operator is defined for all basic types (e.g., int, float, etc)

   Each file can optionally be assigned a header string using LogFile::logHeader()
   which will be written out at the top of the log file.  LogFile::logHeader() must be
   called before the first call to LogFile::logData for a particular file.

	The data write is performed in a seperate thread.  This means when the program is going to terminate
	the LogFile object (or more precisely the LogFileWrite object) must be allow to
	finish writing any data it has in its buffer which has not yet been written.
	Currently this functionality is implemented by MainApp::terminate which sends a signal
	which is received by LogFileWrite when the program is about to exit, and by MainApp::add_thread()
	which allows LogFileWrite to tell MainApp it exists so that the main program can wait
	until LogFileWrite terminates before exiting.

   \code
	using std::vector;

	vector<float> norms(8);

	LogFile *log = LogFile::getInstance();

	boost::this_thread::at_thread_exit(cleanup());

	log->logHeader("normalized outputs", "CH1(us)\tCH2(us)\tCH3(us)\tCH4(us)\tCH5(us)\tCH6(us)\tCH7(us)\tCH8(us)");
	for (int i=0; i<10; i++)
	{
		BOOST_FOREACH(float & norm, norms)
		{
			norm = rand() % 1000 + 1000;
		}
		log->logData("normalized outputs", norms);
		boost::this_thread::sleep(boost::posix_time::seconds(3));
	}
   \endcode

   \todo Add the ability to set a base directory
   \todo Create a subdirectory using a date/time stamp to store the output data
